-----1. Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

ifconfig | cut -d " " -f1 -s | cut -d ":" -f1 -s

2. Identify the IP address of the Ethernet interface

ifconfig en0 | grep "inet "

-----3. Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card

ifconfig wlan0 grep "Hardware Adress"

4. Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table

netstat -nr | grep "default"

5. Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: slash16.org

nslookup slash16.org

6. Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server you’re using

/etc/resolv.conf

In Linux and Unix like computer operating systems, the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file contains information that allows a computer connected to the Internet to convert alpha-numeric names into the numeric IP addresses that are required for access to external network resources on the Internet. The process of converting domain names to IP addresses is called “resolving.”
The resolv.conf file typically contains the IP addresses of nameservers (DNS name resolvers) that attempt to translate names into addresses for any node available on the network.

7. Query an external DNS server on the slash16.org domain name (ie. : google 8.8.8.8)

dig -x slash16.org

8. Find the provider of slash16.org

nslookup slach16.org
whois 10.51.1.253

9. Find the external IP of 42.fr

163.172.250.11
163.172.250.12

10. Identify the network devices between your computer and the slash16.org domain

traceroute slash16.org

-----11. Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world



12. Check that the server with the 10.51.1.253 IP address is reachable from your computer.

ping 10.51.1.253

-----13. Figure out the server type.



14. Use the Reverse DNS to find out the name of the server linked to the 10.51.1.81

nslookup 10.51.1.81

15. What file contains the local DNS entries?

On Unix, /etc/hosts file contains mappings between an IP address and a name of the host. It overrides mappings from DNS.

16. Make the 46.19.122.85 address reroute to intra.42.fr
